/**
 * When the page is opened, and — mostly — when it is not.
 *
 * Every one of these refusals is a way of being wrong that is hard to
 * diagnose from the symptom. A launcher that blocks on a runner turns a green
 * job into one that hangs for six hours; a window opening on a server's console
 * because a supervisor started the service is a surprise nobody can trace back
 * to a line of code.
 *
 * Nothing here spawns anything: the decision is the part worth testing, and the
 * spawn is one line beneath it.
